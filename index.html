            <h2>Blog Post Title 1 : JULIET’S LIBRARY</h2>
            <p>Posted on <time datetime="2024-01-06">January 6, 2024</time></p>
            <p> I discovered Juliet’s stunning blog recently. I was very much drawn by her beautiful, well styled pictures. If you need a crash course on book photography, spend a few minutes browsing her photos. Minutes will turn into hours, I warn you from experience. Juliet is a part time editor who loves books, and quietness of cities. She enjoys exploring the neighbourhood for good coffeeshops. Her reading lists are great places to find new books—brief and to-the-point, accompanied by her bookish photos. Start with Juliet’s summer reading list or her Instagram guide to New York city.
